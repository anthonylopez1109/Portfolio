## üîÑ Project 2: Crowdfunding ETL Pipeline

### Overview:
This project involves building an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline** for a crowdfunding platform. Using **Python**, **Pandas**, and **PostgreSQL**, I extracted data from provided spreadsheets, cleaned and transformed it into structured DataFrames, and loaded the data into a PostgreSQL database.

### Key Components:
- **ETL Process**: Extracted data from **crowdfunding.xlsx** and **contacts.xlsx**, transformed it, and loaded into CSVs and PostgreSQL.
- **Database Design**: Created an **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)** and designed a **PostgreSQL schema** for the crowdfunding database.
- **Data Export**: Exported structured data into **CSV files** for further analysis.

### Data Files:
- `crowdfunding.xlsx` (Crowdfunding campaign data)
- `contacts.xlsx` (Contact information for campaigns)
- **CSV Files**:
  - `category.csv`
  - `subcategory.csv`
  - `campaign.csv`
  - `contacts.csv`
- **SQL Schema**: `crowdfunding_db_schema.sql`

## üåç Project 3: Flu Trends Analysis and Visualization

### Overview:
This project focuses on creating an interactive **dashboard** to visualize **flu trends** across the United States, based on **age groups** and **virus types**. The dashboard provides insights into flu activity, mortality rates, and regional trends, assisting in **public health decision-making**.

### Key Features:
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Built using **Dash** and **Plotly**, allowing users to interact with flu data through filters.
- **Data Sources**: Data from **CDC FluView Interactive** and the **National Center for Health Statistics**.
- **Ethical Considerations**: All data was anonymized and handled according to **CDC guidelines** to ensure privacy and accuracy.

### Tools Used:
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and cleaning
- **Matplotlib**: Static visualizations
- **Plotly/Dash**: Interactive visualizations and dashboards
- **SQLAlchemy**: For loading data from a **PostgreSQL database**

### Instructions:
1. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Dashboard: python app.py
